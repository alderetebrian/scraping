# United Kingdom Scraping Emails


Various scraps and crawlers are used to obtain emails from therapists in the united kingdom


The idea is that each scrap extracts and creates in the same file what it manages to extract, to later eliminate duplicates.
and segment these scraps by hours/days


Also, if an error arises, the scraps say which page they stayed on in order to resume, without losing the information.


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  pip install requirements.txt
```


And once all the libraries have been installed (a virtual environment is recommended)

To run these programs, over time they will be updated and a CLI will be created
